 * Simple proxy server for IOTA.
 * Relays commands to the IOTA Tangle, but intercepts attachToTangle commands and performs PoW locally.
 *
 * This proxy server useful for when you want to perform transfers with iota.lib.js in Node but do not
 * have access to a full node that grants you access to the necessary attachToTangle commands.
